# Summary
I was curious about how long I've studied since learning to code. Here's what I did to answer this question:
- download yearly csvs from [Toggl](https://toggl.com) time tracker
- write hoursStudied.py to sum them all up

# Reproduce Results

- git clone https://github.com/geofflangenderfer/programmingHoursStudied.git
- cd programmingHoursStudied
- python3 hoursStudied.py
