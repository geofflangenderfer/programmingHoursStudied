# Total Hours Studied
I was curious about how long I've studied since learning to code. Here's what I did to answer this question:
- download yearly csvs from [Toggl](https://toggl.com) time tracker
- write summary.py to sum them all up

## Reproduce Results

```
~/Downloads » git clone https://github.com/geofflangenderfer/programmingHoursStudied.git
~/Downloads » cd programmingHoursStudied
Downloads/programmingHoursStudied [master●] » python3 summary.py
Yearly Hours: 149.49083333333334

Yearly Hours: 496.2688888888889

Yearly Hours: 670.1663888888894

Yearly Hours: 488.13333333333355

Overall: 1804.0594444444455
